[cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands are used to show the\ninteractions between generic enablers.\n\nThe `docker-compose` files for this tutorial can be found on GitHub: \n\n![GitHub](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.XACML-Access-Rules/icon/GitHub-Mark-32px.png) [FIWARE 405: Ruleset Based Permissions](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.XACML-Access-Rules)\n\n\n# Ruleset Based Permissions\n\n> \"Say: Come, I will rehearse what _Allah_ hath prohibited you from:\n>\n> -   Join not anything as equal with _Him_\n> -   Be good to your parents\n> -   Kill not your children on a plea of want - _We_ provide sustenance for you\n>     and for them\n> -   Come not nigh to shameful deeds. Whether open or secret\n> -   Take not life, which _Allah_ hath made sacred, except by way of justice\n>     and law\n>\n> thus doth _He_ command you, that ye may learn wisdom.\"\n>\n> — Quran 6.151, Sūrat al-Anʻām\n\n[Previous tutorials](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Securing-Access) have\nintroduced a simple access control system based on authentication (level 1) or\nbasic authorization access to resources based on a role (level 2). These\npolicies are easy to create, but the rules within them are very black and white,\nrules cannot rely on one another, have exception clauses or offer access based\non time limits or attribute values. There is also no mechanism to resolve\ndifferent rules in the case of conflict.\n\nTo satisfy a complex access control scenario, an additional arbitration\nmicroservice is required, which is able to come to a judgement on each\nPermit/Deny policy decision by reading and interpreting the full set of access\ncontrol rules, and based their judgement on the evidence provided by the\nrequesting service.\n\nFIWARE [Authzforce](https://authzforce-ce-fiware.readthedocs.io/) is a service\nwhich is able to provide such an interpretive Policy Decision Point (PDP). It is\nan advanced access control Generic Enabler which is able to interpret rules\nsupplied using the\n[XACML standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xacml).\nRulesets can be amended and uploaded at any time providing a flexible method to\nmaintain security policies which can change according to business need.\nFurthermore the language used to describe the access policy is designed to be\nhighly extensible and cover any access control scenario.\n\n## What is XACML\n\neXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is a vendor neutral\ndeclarative access control policy language. It was created to promote common\naccess control terminology and interoperability. The architectural naming\nconventions for elements such as Policy Execution Point (PEP) and Policy\nDecision Point (PDP) come from the XACML specifications.\n\nXACML policies are split into a hierarchy of three levels - `<PolicySet>`,\n`<Policy>` and `<Rule>`, the `<PolicySet>` is a collection of `<Policy>`\nelements each of which contain one or more `<Rule>` elements.\n\nEach `<Rule>` within a `<Policy>` is evaluated as to whether it should grant\naccess to a resource - the overall `<Policy>` result is defined by the overall\nresult of all `<Rule>` elements processed in turn. Separate `<Policy>` results\nare then evaluated against each other using combining alogorthms define which\n`<Policy>` wins in case of conflict.\n\nA `<Rule>` element consists of a `<Target>` and a `<Condition>`. This is an\nexample `<Rule>`, it states access will be granted (`Effect=\"Permit\"`) when a\nPOST request is sent to the `/bell/ring` endpoint, provided that the\n`subject:role` has been provided and that the\n`role=security-role-0000-0000-000000000000` :\n\n```xml\n<Rule RuleId=\"alrmbell-ring-0000-0000-000000000000\" Effect=\"Permit\">\n  <Description>Ring Alarm Bell</Description>\n  <Target>\n    <AnyOf>\n      <AllOf>\n        <Match MatchId=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal\">\n          <AttributeValue DataType=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\">/bell/ring</AttributeValue>\n          <AttributeDesignator Category=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource\" AttributeId=\"urn:thales:xacml:2.0:resource:sub-resource-id\" DataType=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\" MustBePresent=\"true\" />\n        </Match>\n      </AllOf>\n    </AnyOf>\n    <AnyOf>\n      <AllOf>\n        <Match MatchId=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal\">\n          <AttributeValue DataType=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\">POST</AttributeValue>\n          <AttributeDesignator Category=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action\" AttributeId=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id\" DataType=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\" MustBePresent=\"true\" />\n        </Match>\n      </AllOf>\n    </AnyOf>\n  </Target>\n  <Condition>\n    <Apply FunctionId=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:any-of\">\n      <Function FunctionId=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal\" />\n      <AttributeValue DataType=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\">security-role-0000-0000-000000000000</AttributeValue>\n      <AttributeDesignator Category=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject-category:access-subject\" AttributeId=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:subject:role\" DataType=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\" MustBePresent=\"false\" />\n    </Apply>\n  </Condition>\n</Rule>\n```\n\nThis is a very verbose method for creating a simple Verb-Resource access rule,\nbut unlike simple Verb-Resource rules, with XACML, other more complex\ncomparisons can be made, for example checking that time is before a certain hour\nof day, or checking that a URL starts with or contains a certain string.\nConditions can be specified down to the attribute level or combined to make\ncomplex calculations, for example - an XACML `<Rule>` could be created to apply\nthe following policy:\n\n> _A store manager is able to amend Product prices only the first of the month,\n> and can only alter prices of products she or her immediate superior has\n> created in the first place_\n\nSuch a `<Rule>` would require that the `<Condition>` includes separate\nclauses/clarifications for the following:\n\n-   What is the User's role? (e.g. `manager`)\n-   What action is being invoked? (e.g PATCH or PUT)\n-   Which resource is being protected URL string? (e.g. `/v2/entities`)\n-   What other information must be present in the body of the request? (e.g.\n    Entity `type` must equal `Product`)\n-   When is the resource being requested? (e.g. the current date)\n-   What other additional information must be retrieved from elsewhere prior to\n    making the request\n    -   Who created the entity? Is it me or my manager?\n\nAs you can see these rules can quickly become very complex. For this initial\nintroduction to XACML, the basic rule set used will be kept as simple as\npossible to avoid unnecessary confusion, suffice it to say that an access policy\nbased on XACML can be expanded to fit the security needs of any complex system.\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n## Docker\n\nTo keep things simple all components will be run using\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com). **Docker** is a container technology which\nallows to different components isolated into their respective environments.\n\n-   To install Docker on Windows follow the instructions\n    [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)\n-   To install Docker on Mac follow the instructions\n    [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)\n-   To install Docker on Linux follow the instructions\n    [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n\n**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker\napplications. A\n[YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/tutorials.Identity-Management/master/docker-compose.yml)\nis used configure the required services for the application. This means all\ncontainer services can be brought up in a single command. Docker Compose is\ninstalled by default as part of Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac, however\nLinux users will need to follow the instructions found\n[here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n## Cygwin\n\nWe will start up our services using a simple bash script. Windows users should\ndownload [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) to provide a command-line\nfunctionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.\n\n# Architecture\n\nThis application adds level 3 Advanced Authorization security into the existing\nStock Management and Sensors-based application created in\n[previous tutorials](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Securing-Access/) and\nsecures access to the context broker behind a\n[PEP Proxy](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.PEP-Proxy/). It will make use of\nfive FIWARE components - the\n[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),the\n[IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),\nthe [Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Identity Manager,\nthe [Wilma]() PEP Proxy and the\n[Authzforce](https://authzforce-ce-fiware.readthedocs.io) XACML Server. All\naccess control decisions will be delegated to **Authzforce** which will read the\nruleset from a previously uploaded policy domain.\n\nBoth the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on open source\n[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep persistence of the\ninformation they hold. We will also be using the dummy IoT devices created in\nthe [previous tutorial](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.IoT-Sensors/).\n**Keyrock** uses its own [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database.\n\nTherefore the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:\n\n-   The FIWARE\n    [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which\n    will receive requests using\n    [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)\n-   The FIWARE\n    [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n    which will receive southbound requests using\n    [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) and convert\n    them to\n    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)\n    commands for the devices\n-   FIWARE [Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offer a\n    complement Identity Management System including:\n    -   An OAuth2 authentication system for Applications and Users\n    -   A site graphical frontend for Identity Management Administration\n    -   An equivalent REST API for Identity Management via HTTP requests\n-   FIWARE [Authzforce](https://authzforce-ce-fiware.readthedocs.io/) is a XACML\n    Server providing an interpretive Policy Decision Point (PDP) access to the\n    **Orion** and/or **IoT Agent** microservices\n-   FIWARE [Wilma](https://fiware-pep-proxy.rtfd.io/) is a PEP Proxy securing\n    access to the **Orion** microservices, it delegates the passing of\n    authorisation decisions to **Authzforce** PDP\n-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :\n    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information\n        such as data entities, subscriptions and registrations\n    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs\n        and Keys\n-   A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database :\n    -   Used to persist user identities, applications, roles and permissions\n-   The **Stock Management Frontend** does the following:\n    -   Displays store information\n    -   Shows which products can be bought at each store\n    -   Allows users to \"buy\" products and reduce the stock count.\n    -   Allows authorized users into restricted areas, it also delegates\n        authoriation decisions to the **Authzforce** PDP\n-   A webserver acting as set of\n    [dummy IoT devices](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.IoT-Sensors) using\n    the\n    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)\n    protocol running over HTTP - access to certain resources is restricted.\n\nSince all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the\nentities can be containerized and run from exposed ports.\n\n![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.XACML-Access-Rules/img/architecture.png)\n\nThe specific architecture of each section of the tutorial is discussed below.\n\n## Keyrock Configuration\n\n```yaml\nkeyrock:\n    image: fiware/idm\n    container_name: fiware-keyrock\n    hostname: keyrock\n    networks:\n        default:\n            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.5\n    depends_on:\n        -

Access control levels 1 and 2 have been covered in\n[previous tutorials](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Securing-Access) and\ncan be fulfilled using **Keyrock** alone or with or without an associated PEP\nProxy.\n\nAdvanced Authorization is able to deal with complex rulesets.

Such users may also\n`DELETE` **provided that** they were the creator in the first place.\n\nWithin the tutorial programatic example we are using our own trusted instance of\n**Keyrock** - once a user has signed in and obtained an `access_token`, the\n`access_token` can be stored in session and used to retrieve user details on\ndemand.

Authzforce responds with a **permit** or **deny** response, and the\ndecision whether to continue can be made thereafter.\n\n```javascript\nfunction authorizeAdvancedXACML(req, res, next, resource = req.url) {\n    const keyrockUserUrl =\n        \"http://keyrock/user?access_token=\" +\n        req.session.access_token +\n        \"&app_id=\" +\n        clientId +\n        \"&authzforce=true\";\n\n    return oa\n        .get(keyrockUserUrl)\n        .then(response => {\n            const user = JSON.parse(response);\n            return azf.policyDomainRequest(\n                user.app_azf_domain,\n                user.roles,\n                resource,\n                req.method\n            );\n        })\n        .then(authzforceResponse => {\n            res.locals.authorized = authzforceResponse === \"Permit\";\n            return next();\n        })\n        .catch(error => {\n            debug(error);\n            res.locals.authorized = false;\n            return next();\n        });\n}\n```\n\nThe full code to supply each request to Authzforce can be found within the\ntutorials'\n[Git Repository](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Step-by-Step/blob/master/context-provider/lib/azf.js) -\nthe actual information to supply will depend on business use case - it could be\nexpanded to include temporal information, relationships between records and so\non, but in this very simple example only roles are necessary.\n\n```javascript\nconst xml2js = require(\"xml2js\");\nconst request = require(\"request\");\n\nfunction policyDomainRequest(domain, roles, resource, action) {\n    let body =\n        '<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\\n' +\n        '<Request xmlns=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17\" CombinedDecision=\"false\" ReturnPolicyIdList=\"false\">\\n';\n    // Code to create the XML body for the request is omitted\n    body = body + \"</Request>\";\n\n    const options = {\n        method: \"POST\",\n        url: \"http://authzforceUrl/authzforce-ce/domains/\" + domain + \"/pdp\",\n        headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/xml\" },\n        body\n    };\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        request(options, function(error, response, body) {\n            let decision;\n            xml2js.parseString(\n                body,\n                { tagNameProcessors: [xml2js.processors.stripPrefix] },\n                function(err, jsonRes) {\n                    // The decision is found within the /Response/Result[0]/Decision[0] XPath\n                    decision = jsonRes.Response.Result[0].Decision[0];\n                }\n            );\n            decision = String(decision);\n            return error ? reject(error) : resolve(decision);\n        });\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Advanced Authorization - PEP Proxy\n\nApplying advanced authorization within a PEP proxy requires very similar code to\nthe programmatic example described above. The **Wilma** generic enabler extracts\na token from the header supplied by the request and makes a request to\n**Keyrock** to obtain further information about the user. A PDP request is then\nmade to **Authzforce** to decide whether to procede.\n\nObviously any scalable solution should also cache information about the PDP\nrequests made and the responses to avoid making unnecessary requests.\n\n## PDP - Advanced Authorization - Running the Example\n\n> **Note** Five resources have been secured at level 3:\n>\n> -   sending the unlock door command\n> -   sending the ring bell command\n> -   access to the price-change area\n> -   access to the order-stock area\n> -   access to Orion (behind a PEP Proxy)\n\n#### Eve the Eavesdropper\n\nEve has an account, but no roles in the application.\n\n> **Note** As Eve has a recognized account, she gains full authentication\n> access. This means she is able to _view_ the Store page, even though her\n> account has no roles attached.\n\n-   From `http://localhost:3000`, log in as `eve@example.com` with the password\n    `test`\n\n##### Level 3 : Advanced Authorization Access\n\n-   Click on any store page - access to view the page is **permitted** for any\n    logged in users, however access to retrieve Orion data is now **denied**\n    since Eve has no role which permits access.\n\n-   Click on the restricted access links at `http://localhost:3000` - access is\n    **denied**\n-   Open the Device Monitor on `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`\n    -   Unlock a door - access is **denied**\n    -   Ring a bell - access is **denied**\n\n#### Bob The Regional Manager\n\nBob has the **management** role\n\n-   From `http://localhost:3000`, log in as `bob-the-manager@test.com` with the\n    password `test`\n\n##### Level 3 : Advanced Authorization Access\n\n-   Click on the restricted access links at `http://localhost:3000` - access is\n    **permitted** - This is a management only permission\n-   Open the Device Monitor on `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`\n    -   Unlock a door - access is **denied**. - This is a security only\n        permission\n    -   Ring a bell - access is **permitted** - This is permitted to management\n        users\n\n#### Charlie the Security Manager\n\nCharlie has the **security** role\n\n-   From `http://localhost:3000`, log in as `charlie-security@test.com` with the\n    password `test`\n\n##### Level 3: Advanced Authorization Access\n\n-   Click on the restricted access links at `http://localhost:3000` - access is\n    **denied** - This is a management only permission\n-   Open the Device Monitor on `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`\n    -   Unlock a door - access is **permitted** - This is a security only\n        permission\n    -   Ring a bell - access is **permitted** - This is permitted to security\n        users"
